To run the model, one must first put the train set, train label and test set in the same folder as the model.py file. The train set should be named “train_x.npy”, the training labels “train_y.csv” and the test set “test_x.npy”. Then, the program can be run from start to finish by executing the whole file. It produces an output, “predictions.csv”, that can be used to assess the accuracy.
